## Set up

The SQL table layout is currently not public, but can be
reverse-engineered from the code (look at the unit tests, hinthint).

To install all the dependencies get [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)
and then run `composer install` or `php composer.phar install`, depending on how
you installed it. This will then download all the deps and set them up.

### Run tests
After installing Composer you can run the unit tests:
```bash
php vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autload.php test
```

You might want to customize the `phpunit.xml` to match the database credentials
of your system. The unit tests expect a database called `twitchbots`.
